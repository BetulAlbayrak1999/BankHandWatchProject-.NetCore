### This Web Api project is made using .NetCore 5.0 Technology for Patika Bootcamp.

### The main aim of the project is to find a different way for using bank ATM.

#### Explaining the project and the needs of it: My project is providing each customer that have an bank account with a watch that they can use at ATM instead of bank cards. This idea came to my mind when I saw that many customers face with a problem which is forgetting the bank card in different places, so I wanted with this project to find a solution for this problem by replacing bank cards with a wristwatch that could be with the customer all time.

My project in this repository has only the models in DataAccess Layer.
